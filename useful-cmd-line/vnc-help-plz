On server, start up vnc: 

	$ vncserver -localhost -geometry 1200x650

This gives you a session number (let's call it n) and sets everything up. Good idea to comment out the last line in ~/.vnc/xstartup from "twm &" to "/usr/bin/gnome-session" 

Then back in the command line on the server: 

	$ press enter a few times
	$ (SHIFT + ~)
	$ (SHIFT + C)
	$ L 590(m):localhost:590(n)

When typing the second two commands, you shouldn't see any output on the screen. If you do, hit enter a few times and redo it.

When you type in the first command, it gives you the vnc session number (n). E.g. 1, 2 .. This has to be the same in the second number in the last command. The first number (m) refers to your machine (e.g. laptop). Usually it works fine to pick the same number, but sometimes if a session fails that number won't work from an old session.

On laptop terminal (Mac),

	$ open vnc://localhost:5902


Then to re open an existing vnc session, the very first line is not necessary

Feb1, 2017 edit: 
- When restarting a machine, need to log in on the physical desktop to open up an X session which vnc can connect to (Prakash thinks...)

- do not use gnome-session in the .vnc/xstartup file, it doesn't like it

- don't need -x while ssh'ing in

- delete and recreate the .vnc/passwd file
