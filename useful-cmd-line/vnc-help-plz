I'm trying the following to view Thorne (ICES machine) from my Mac

On thorne, start up vnc server: 
	vncserver

-> this gives me :1, say. Do I make both of the below ports the same? does it matter?

On Mac,

	ssh -p 8704 -f -N -L 5901:thorne.ices.utexas.edu:5901 thorne.ices.utexas.edu
	open vnc://thorne.ices.utexas.edu:1

-f: run ssh in the background 
-N: Doesn't execute a remote command, for forwarding ports
