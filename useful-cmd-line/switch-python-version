This is to switch python version within python 
e.g. standard I run python 3.6, but to use a module in 2.7 need to switch

1. Switch to a python version 2.7 environment
    
    $ conda create -n py27 python=2.7 anaconda

    -- If this version is not already installed, anaconda will get to work installing    -- go get a coffee or distract your friends from working to pass the time

2. Activate the environment, this will show up in the prompt, but here's how to check

    $ source activate py27

3. Verify you're in the right environment

    $ conda info --envs

4. Check python version
    
    $ python --version

5. To switch back, exit the terminal 

-----------------

to test modifications under a different python version, e.g. to xmitgcm
here's an example going from default python=3.7 to test mods with python=2.7

    $ conda create --yes -n test_env python=2.7 anaconda xarray future
    $ conda activate test_env
    $ conda install -c conda-forge docrep

note -c conda-forge is necessary to look through the conda-forge channel, 
where docrep exists
This creates the test_env environment with python version 2.7 and has the modules 
xarray, future, and docrep installed

Note: at first I was having problems because Ekman has ~/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
which has a really old version of numpy in it ... moving this to old_python2.7
made it so it's not added to path
