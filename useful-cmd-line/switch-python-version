This is to switch python version within python 
e.g. standard I run python 3.6, but to use a module in 2.7 need to switch

1. Switch to a python version 2.7 environment
    
    $ conda create -n py27 python=2.7 anaconda

    -- If this version is not already installed, anaconda will get to work installing    -- go get a coffee or distract your friends from working to pass the time

2. Activate the environment, this will show up in the prompt, but here's how to check

    $ source activate py27

3. Verify you're in the right environment

    $ conda info --envs

4. Check python version
    
    $ python --version

5. To switch back, exit the terminal
