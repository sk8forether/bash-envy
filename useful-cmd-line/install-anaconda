### How I installed anaconda on

- my mac
- Ekman
- Sverdrup

### 

1. Download appropriate file for Mac or linux here 
    https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html

2. Follow prompt ... on sverdrup, I installed to /home/tsmith/anaconda3

3. I grabbed the following modules 

    conda install future
    conda install xarray netCDF4 bottleneck
# Note: based on my last installation, it seems worth trying to install
# cartopy from pkgs/main raither than conda-forge...
# because installing from conda-forge makes the 
# pkgs/main::conda -> conda-forge::conda
    conda install -c conda-forge cartopy docrep pyresample cmocean xesmf
    conda install datashader
    conda install -c pyviz holoviews geoviews


3.5 NOTE:

if you have trouble with corrupted packages, like mkl, with messages like

CondaVerificationError: The package for mkl located at /workspace/anaconda3/pkgs/mkl-2019.3-199
appears to be corrupted. The path 'lib/libmkl_avx512.so'
specified in the package manifest cannot be found.

then run the following command

    conda clean --packages --tarballs
    

4. I cloned the following repos so I could modify them
but these can also be installed "the easy way"

    xgcm
        -- needs xarray, which uses netCDF4 and bottleneck (latter for speed)
        -- needs docrep and future
        Easy way: see https://xgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
        My way:
            1. git clone git@github.com:xgcm/xgcm.git
            2. add to bashrc: 
                export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:path/to/xgcm
            
    xmitgcm
        -- needs xgcm   
        Easy way: see https://xmitgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
        My way:
            1. git clone git@github.com:xgcm/xmitgcm.git
            2. add to bashrc: 
                export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:path/to/xmitgcm

    MITgcm_recipes
        Some ASTE plotting scripts from Raphael Dussin
            1. git clone git@github.com:raphaeldussin/MITgcm-recipes.git
            2. add to bashrc: 
                export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:path/to/MITgcm-recipes
