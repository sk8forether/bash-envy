Would like to use 'sync' command to sync between cloud and local. 

However, this is a one way operation. So syncing (a) to (b) deletes updates on (b).

To avoid... 

1. Look for files that will be deleted with --dry-run flag.
2. Copy those files to [source] so both locations have them.
3. Go through with sync.

For example, I want to update local machine with contents of remote.

1. 

    rclone sync --dry-run [source]:[dir] [destination]:[dir]

e.g.

    rclone sync --dry-run remote:CSEM-Thorne/papers /workspace/drive/CSEM-Thorne/papers

Look for files that will be deleted. For example: 

2018/03/12 13:29:58 NOTICE: ECCO/Menemenlis_2008_ECCO2-description.pdf: Not deleting as --dry-run

this file would get deleted from my local machine since it was updated here but not 
on remote. 


2. 

    rclone copy [source]:[dir] [destination]:[dir]

e.g.

    rclone copy /workspace/drive/CSEM-Thorne/papers/ECCO/Menemenlis_2008_ECCO2-description.pdf remote:CSEM-Thorne/papers/ECCO

and continue as needed ...
Check the dry run command as above. 

3. Run sync without --dry-run flag.
