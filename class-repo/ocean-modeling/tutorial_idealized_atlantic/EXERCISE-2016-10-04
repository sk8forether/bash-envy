Based in the configuration tutorial_idealized_atlantic/ provided, do the following:
1. Configure the setup such as to
   - run for 100 years
   - produce yearly output (snapshots and timeaverages)
   a) Diagnose equilibration in both global mean heat content and sea surface temperature as a function of time.
   b) Plot basic quantities at year 100 (temperature, salinity, horizontal velocity vector, vertical velocity, sea surface height); for 3-D fields, look at these values at depth levels 20 m and 1350 m.

2. Re-run model with a couple of changes:
a) double rotation period
b) quadruple rotation period
c) times 8 rotation period
d) reverse zonal wind stress
e) reverse zonal wind stress and multiply by 4

NOTES:
* for experiments a)-c):
  - you will need to add in parameter file "data"
    the parameter rotationPeriod;
  - for larger rotation periods you will notice that the model blows up
    ("NaN" in standard output);
    to remedy, cut down time step deltaT in half;
    don't forget to increase number of time steps accordingly
    so as to still run for 100 years
* for experiments d)-e):
  - read given wind stress file "windx_12x28x7.bin" using Matlab,
    manipulate, and generate modified file with new file name.
  - don't forget to specify modified filename in parameter file "data".
