\begin{abstract}
  We are interested in the variability of AMOC at 34$^{\circ}$S over time scales ranging from a few months to ~10-20 years. This location is of particular interest because there are two pilot boundary arrays located here (at 34.5$^{\circ}$): on the Eastern boundary two sensors as part of the GoodHope program (Feb2008-Dec2010) and the Southwest Atlantic MOC array (deployed March 2009) on the Western boundary \cite{meinenSamoc}. These systems are made up of Inverted Echo Sounders (IES), with a pressure sensor (PIES), and in some places a current meter (CPIES). While these arrays were not put in place to monitor AMOC, we use the data provided to compare computer model calculations of the AMOC. Here we use the MITgcm parameters fit to observations as in ECCO v4 r2 (much more here) \cite{forgetEccov4}. Defining the AMOC as an objective function and using the adjoint mode of this code allows us to compute sensitivities of AMOC to various external forcings (wind stress, buoyancy fluxes, ...). The purpose here is to find the causal mechanisms of variability and the timescales on which they act. While a 20 year time frame is not nearly enough to establish statistically meaningful trends in AMOC's behavior, it is certainly true that continuing or reestablishing observation systems will give a clearer picture of AMOC's low frequency variability and trends.

\section{Bullets}
Some interesting finds after computing 20 year adjoint sensitivity fields of AMOC to external forcing fields. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item After some readjustment time, the sensitivity fields seem to be identical between a december and July cost function. How to compare this more rigorously? 
	\item The RMS (or really L2 norm) and mean behavior of sensitivities looks relatively identical 
	\item Comparing the sensitivities to the exact same setup computed at 25N shows that at 25 north 
\end{enumerate}

\section{AMOC lit review}

Here are some main points from \cite{lozier}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Global ocean circulation used to be termed ``conveyor belt'' or ``thermohaline'' circulation. The first comes from early discoveries of warm saline waters traveling poleward to cool and sink to depth, then travel southward. Thermohaline refers to density driven flow. The lack of continuity/coherency from one latitude to another disproves the first (e.g. an increase in warming, decrease in convection does not have an impact on abyssal return flow in a yearly time frame). The importance of wind stress disproves the second (The Gulf stream is largely wind driven, and the subtropical gyre in the Atlantic is a wind driven circulation). 
	\item 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Methods}
\label{methods}
  
  \subsection{AMOC definition}
  
    The domain of interest is the zonal cross section of the Atlantic ocean at 34$^{\circ}$S, from the Western coast in the Aghulas Basin to the Cape of Good Hope Basin in the East. In cartesian coordinates, we denote this as: $x \in [x_W,x_E], y = y(\phi=34^{\circ}S), z \in [-H,\eta(y,t)]$ (spherical coordinates are used in the computation, however).  We define the meridional overturning stream function as follows: 
    
    \begin{equation}
      \pderiv[]{\psi_{MOC}}{y}(y,z,t) = \int_{x_W}^{x_E}w(x,y,z,t)\,dx \qquad\text{;}\qquad \pderiv[]{\psi_{MOC}}{z}(y,z,t) = -\int_{x_W}^{x_E}v(x,y,z,t)\,dx .
     \label{eq:mocStf}
    \end{equation}

   Assuming no normal flow at $z = -H$, the stream function is given by:
   \begin{equation}
    \psi_{MOC}(y,z,t) = -\int_{-H}^{z}\int_{x_W}^{x_E}v(x,y,z,t)\,dx\,dz .
    \label{eq:mocStf2}
   \end{equation}

   Note that with this definition, volume transport moving northward is positive. AMOC is defined as the maximum value of this stream function: 
   
   \begin{equation}
    AMOC(y,z_{max},t) = \max_{-H < z < \eta(y,t)}{\psi_{MOC}(y,z,t)} ,
    \label{eq:amoc}
   \end{equation}

   where it is important to note that this value is a function of time and latitude (here denoted as $y$). Here we use monthly mean values for meridional velocity ($\bar{v}$), so that AMOC as a monthly mean quantity. Using results from ECCOv4r2 \cite{forgetEccov4}, the overturning stream function along with its mean and standard deviation over the period 1992-2011 is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:mocStfStats}. At this location and over this time frame, AMOC has a mean value of 14.25 Sv with a standard deviation of 3.14 Sv, where the maximizing depth has a mean and standard deviation 1422m +/- 56m (median depth 1461.4m). Note that the vertical grid spacing at this depth is approximately 100m. \red{Mention that AMOC is normally distributed, cite \cite{wunschAndHeimbach_AMOC}? give measure of normality?}. These are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:samocStats}. Compared to calculations by Meinen et al \cite{meinenSamoc}, these values are slightly lower in the mean, and show far less variation on monthly time periods: they show, in some months, variation up to 30 Sv. I'll discuss these details in section \ref{obsSAMOC}.

   \subsection{Bolus transport considerations}
   \label{bolus}
   
   The meridional overturning stream function due to bolus transport is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:bolusMocStfStats}. Interestingly there is only significant variation in the mixed layer, and very little beyond ~200m. I originally would have expected more variation since this is the ``eddy transport velocity''. Do we not see variation because I'm using monthly mean values? 
   
   Including the bolus transport increases the 20 year mean AMOC value to 16 Sv, and raises the mean depth to ~1397m (median 1356.9m) (as opposed to 14.25 Sv, 1460m respectively). The standard deviations remain essentially unchanged at 3.15 Sv and 62m.

Including the bolus transport increases the 20 year mean AMOC value to 16 Sv, and raises the depth to ~1360m (as opposed to 14.25 Sv, 1460m respectively).}
    \label{fig:res_samocStats}
   \end{figure}

   \subsection{Observers SAMOC}
    \label{obsSAMOC}
    
    Following e.g. Meinen et al \cite{meinenSamoc} and McCarthy \cite{mcCarthy}, we construct the observers AMOC at 34\degSym S with the following components: 
    
    \begin{enumerate}
     \item Ekman transport: Computed using monthly mean of 6 hour ERA-Interim re-analysis fields (Dee et al. 2011), interpolated to ocean grid at surface over 1992-2011. The volumetric transport at latitude $y$ is: %
     
     \begin{equation}
      T_{ek}(y,t) = -\int_W^E\frac{\tau_x}{f\rho} \, dx
      \label{eq:ekTransp}
     \end{equation}
     
     where $f$ is the Coriolis paramter at 34\degSym S, $\rho = \rho_0 = 1029 kg/m^3$. 
     
     \item Geostrophic transport: Computed based on the geopotential height anomaly:
     
     \begin{equation}
      T_{geo}(y,z,t) = \int_W^E(v-v_r)dx = \dfrac{1}{f}\int_W^E \dfrac{dp}{\rho} = - \dfrac{1}{f} \int g\,dz = \dfrac{1}{f} \int d\phi= \dfrac{1}{f} (\phi'_E(z) - \phi'_W(z))
      \label{eq:geoTransp}
     \end{equation}
     
     where $\phi'$ is the geopotential surface anomaly which is made up from the surface and hydrostatic components:
     
     \begin{equation}
      \phi'_s \simeq \eta b_0 = \eta g \qquad\text{;}\qquad \phi'_{hyd} = \int_z^{z_{surf}} (b-b_0)dz .
      \label{eq:phiEqns}
     \end{equation}
    
    \item Reference transport: since the geostrophic component is computed relative to a certain level of flow, this is required. Here I use bottom pressure to compute flow at the ocean floor for the reference flow: 
    
    \begin{equation}
     T_{ref}(y,t) = \dfrac{1}{f} \int d\phi= \dfrac{1}{f} (\phi'_E(z) - \phi'_W(z))
     \label{eq:refTransp}
    \end{equation}

    where here bottom pressure anomaly divided by density is used for $\phi'$. 
 
    \end{enumerate}
    
    Currently the geostrophic component is not correct, giving an overturning streamfunction profile as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:geoOvStf}

%    \label{fig:geoOvStf}
%   \end{figure}

   
  \subsection{Linear Sensitivity}
  \label{linearSensitivity}
  
  We define an objective function $\mathcal{J}$ as the monthly mean value of AMOC as in Eqn. \ref{eq:amoc}. Using the adjoint mode of the MITgcm, we then compute the sensitivity of the objective function to model inputs. In this case, the inputs consist of external forces: wind stress, heat, and freshwater fluxes. 
  

	\subsubsection{Algebra}
	
	Defining the cost function $\mathcal{J}$ as monthly mean AMOC. 

	\begin{equation}
	  \mathcal{J}(t) = \bar{\mathcal{J}}(t) + \mathcal{J}'(t)
	\end{equation}

	\begin{equation}
	  \mathcal{J}'(t) = \int\int_{x,y}\int_{1992}^{t}\pderiv{\mathcal{J}}{\mathcal{F}}(x,y,\tau-t)\mathcal{F}'(x,y,\tau)\,d\tau dxdy
	\end{equation}


 \section{Sensitivity Maps}

  Here I want to quickly describe the sensitivity maps of the cost function, $\mathcal{J} = AMOC$, to various forcings $\pderiv{\mathcal{J}}{F}$. 

    \subsection{25N plots}
    \subsubsection{Zonal Wind Stress}
    \begin{enumerate}
	\item T-0 month 
	 \begin{enumerate}
	   \item Large negative band around 25N. Increasing zonal winds in this band will produce Ekman transport ``to the right'' (in the Northern Hem.), effectively reducing AMOC. 
	   \item Signature of Mid-Atlantic ridge visible by negative anomaly in South of 25N and the pocket on the Northern side.
	   \item Positive anomalies on African (Eastern) coast enter equatorial wave guide, travel rapidly in reverse mode Westward toward SA. Due to rapid equatorial Kelvin waves which connect the two coasts. (going on to T-1 month) it releases the Kelvin dual waves Northward and Southward. As noted in \cite{heimbach_timescales} this is significant because it shows a connection for Western boundary sensitivities which originated on the Eastern boundary near Africa, which traveled rapidly across the equator.
	   \item \red{Unsure of the lip around Africa.}
	 \end{enumerate}
	\item T-2 months
	 \begin{enumerate}
	   \item Rossby waves fan out the signal, slanting sensitivities at an angle since waves near the equator travel with a higher phase velocity ($c_p \sim -\beta \sim cos\phi$). 
	   \item \red{Unsure of why there are alternating bands of sensitivity around the original Ekman band. Curious if this is physical or an artifact of the cost function.} 
	   \item Negative anomaly forms near SA in wake of positive dual Kelvin signal propagating South and West, \red{unsure of its origin}. But this propagates Westward (in reverse mode) toward the African boundary in a matter of a month, \red{so would this be a barotropic Rossby wave?}  
	 \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}

   \subsection{34S Plots}
   \subsubsection{Zonal Wind Stress}
	Note how this is essentially the reflection of sensitivity patterns at 25N. 
    \begin{enumerate}
	\item The original symmetric band around the cost function latitude is now positive, since an increase in zonal winds will cause net transport ``to the left'' due to the Coriolis effect. 
	\item The positive anomaly on top of the latitude band (due to baroclinic Rossby waves steering pressure perturbations around the Mid Atlantic Ridge) is of the opposite sign as before. Also, a fainter signal. 
	\item The Eastern boundary current carries a negative anomaly to the gulf of Guinea, which then travels rapidly along the equatorial wave guide (Kelvin dual waves). the exact opposite sign as in Northern hemisphere.
	\item In its wake a positive anomaly forms, which travels Westward \red{still unsure of its origin, and why this turns into an oscillating wave structure traveling Westward across the equator}. 
	\item \red{Baroclinic?} Rossby waves then carry these signals Westward, tilting from SW to NE due to phase speed as mentioned.
	\item Anomalies which travel Southward die out rapidly, and it seems like they get carried by Rossby waves, into the ACC, and pushed into the rough bathymetry of the Drake Passage. At this point the signal has died out. 
	\item \red{Fast barotropic waves carry signal rapidly Northward up the Western coast of SA (an Eastern boundary for the Pacific). Why does this signal oscillate up the coast?} 
    \end{enumerate}
   \subsubsection{Meridional Wind Stress}
    \begin{enumerate}
	\item Can see Mid Atlantic Ridge with + to right, and - to left. 
	\item \red{Is the dipole on the Western side, just a bit off the coast due to rough topography there? This is at the North of the Argentine Basin where the Rio Grande Rise is located.}
	\item Also on the Western side is the Wlave ridge surrounding the Cape Basin
	\item Don't see any other processes communicating these anomalies between coasts other than Rossby waves. 
	\item \red{baroclinically unstable flanks along subtropical gyres?}
	\item See damping to viscous dissipation at high latitudes with low rossby wave speeds
    \end{enumerate}
