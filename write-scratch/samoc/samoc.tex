\begin{abstract}

  The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is widely regarded as a single metric for global ocean circulation, and understanding the dynamics responsible for its variability is thus crucial for determining its role in a global climate system. Here we attribute changes in the AMOC to surface wind, thermal, and fresh water fluxes by computing the influence of forcing anomalies on the AMOC from 1992 to 2011. The ECCO version 4 framework is used for computing sensitivities as an adjoint variable of the AMOC objective function to surface fluxes. We reconstruct the AMOC at the Southernmost latitude band, 34$^{\circ}$S, to show how this region is heavily influenced by processes in the Pacific, Southern, and Indian Ocean basins. \red{This is in} contrast to the AMOC in the North Atlantic (e.g. 26$^{\circ}$N), where the domain of influence is largely in the Atlantic and Subpolar gyre. \red{While observations in this region are even sparser than in the North Atlantic, we show comparisons between the ECCOv4 nonlinear forward model output, linear reconstruction, and observational data from the GoodHope program and Southwest Atlantic MOC array.} Most importantly, heat flux sensitivities are shown to be inaccurate and accumulate error nearly linearly with increasing sensitivity memory time. This accumulation suggests that recirculation of thermal anomalies is not modeled well \red{in the adjoint} and must be improved for AMOC predictability to remain a realistic goal, \red{particularly when projections based on rising air temperature and heat fluxes are of interest.}
  
%  We are interested in the variability of AMOC at 34$^{\circ}$S over time scales ranging from a few months to ~10-20 years. This location is of particular interest because there are two pilot boundary arrays located here (at 34.5$^{\circ}$): on the Eastern boundary two sensors as part of the GoodHope program (Feb2008-Dec2010) and the Southwest Atlantic MOC array (deployed March 2009) on the Western boundary \cite{meinenSamoc}. These systems are made up of Inverted Echo Sounders (IES), with a pressure sensor (PIES), and in some places a current meter (CPIES). While these arrays were not put in place to monitor AMOC, we use the data provided to compare computer model calculations of the AMOC. Here we use the MITgcm parameters fit to observations as in ECCO v4 r2 (much more here) \cite{forgetEccov4}. Defining the AMOC as an objective function and using the adjoint mode of this code allows us to compute sensitivities of AMOC to various external forcings (wind stress, buoyancy fluxes, ...). The purpose here is to find the causal mechanisms of variability and the timescales on which they act. While a 20 year time frame is not nearly enough to establish statistically meaningful trends in AMOC's behavior, it is certainly true that continuing or reestablishing observation systems will give a clearer picture of AMOC's low frequency variability and trends.

\section{Introduction} 
\label{intro}
	
	The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) has been the focus of many studies because of its acceptance as a representation for ocean circulation its correlation to the climate system (Pardaens 2011 ... Meinen refs). While the causal relation between AMOC variability and climatic events (e.g. hurricane activity, rainfall, air temperature) is not clear \cite{wunschAmoc}, decomposing the influence of external forcing and understanding the mechanisms responsible for its variability are crucial for determining its role in the climate system and usefulness in prediction.  

	The AMOC measured in the North Atlantic has been the subject of numerous studies (e.g. \cite{mccarthyAmoc}, \cite{pillarAttribution}, or \cite{lozier} for a more complete list) because of its proximity to the formation of North Atlantic Deep Water \red{cite Stommel, Stouffer? from Dong SAMOCfromSSH} and the observation arrays in the basin \red{e.g. RAPID cite rayner 2011, wunschpg3}. In contrast, we study the MOC in the South Atlantic (SAMOC) because it sits at the ``mouth'' of the Atlantic, funneling warm, salty water from the neighboring ocean basins to the Northern hemisphere (Biastoch et al. 2008; Lee et al. 2011; Kelly et al., 2014, all from Dong, check Dong 2010 too Garzoli and Matano 2011 show water mass exchanges in detail, Dong OFES discusses numerical investigation: Agulhas leakage and ACC important exchanges for vol/ht trsp at 34S.) and distributing cold, salty North Atlantic Deep Water at depth \red{def need refs}. \red{Variability in the region is complicated by rough topography, Agulhas ring ejection from the Cape of Good Hope, and the boundary currents: the Benguela current to the East, and the Brazil and Malvinas confluence on the West.} \cite{meinenSamoc} investigate high frequency variability in the SAMOC based on a 20 month record of daily mooring observations and show that Ekman processes are responsible for variability on the order of 20 days while the geostrophic component is responsible for variation from 20 to 90 days. Based on daily measurements, they report an average value of 21.3 Sv with standard deviation ranging 3.9 to 8.7 Sv depending on the filter used. \red{talk about the other studies} Importantly, \cite{dong20to35} show that SAMOC at 34.5$^{\circ}$S exhibits the most variability of the latitudes investigated, (20$^{\circ}$S-34.5$^{\circ}$S).

	\end{enumerate}


	In the present study we investigate the behavior of the monthly mean MOC at 34$^{\circ}$S using the observation informed MIT general circulation model (MITgcm) under the version 4 release 2 framework developed by the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) Consortium (referred to as ECCOv4r2 from here on, see Section \ref{theModel} for more details) \cite{forgetECCOv4}. Here we define the monthly mean MOC at 34$^{\circ}$S as an objective function, and use the inverse modeling framework developed in \cite{forgetECCOv4} to compute the gradient of this objective function to momentum, thermal, and fresh water forcing evolving backward in time. These sensitivity or influence maps (lagrange multipliers in the context of the adjoint \red{cite}) evolving backward in time show the linear wave dynamics which carry perturbations to the latitude band where the MOC is evaluated. In the context of observing variability, this procedure allows us to quantitatively evaluate the impact of each atmospheric state variable on the variability of SAMOC as well as the \red{effective time scale over which this influence is carried}.  

	Adjoint modeling has proven to be a useful technique for exploring the important dynamics and regional pathways for integrated transport properties. Recently, \cite{czeschelFlorida} implemented an adjoint model for determining the external forcing behind the annual cycle of the Florida Current transport. Here the authors showed that wind stress is the predominant forcing mechanism which determines the annual variability, and that the region of influence is mostly North of the Florida strait, along the Eastern coast. In a similar study to the present \red{one}, \cite{pillarAttribution} attribute variability in AMOC computed at 25$^{\circ}$N and quantitatively show that wind stress dominates high frequency variability (one month to one year), thermal forcing provides low frequency variability (roughly decadal), and fresh water fluxes provide little contributions to variability. Additionally, the reconstructed AMOC (see \cite{pillarAttribution} Eqn. 1) shows good agreement with independent observations provided by the RAPID project \cite{mccarthyAmoc}\red{cite? the one in samocpapers}. 

	In this study we follow a similar approach for SAMOC at 34$^{\circ}$S, but use a realistic atmospheric state rather than climatological forcing, model parameters optimized to observations as in ECCOv4r2, and non-truncated model. The computational framework and mathematical model are described in section \ref{theModel}. In section \ref{sensitivityMaps} we provide a qualitative discussion of the sensitivity maps, and compare the behavior to conclusions from the North Atlantic based on previous work. We then show a quantitative attribution of variability to each of the forcing mechanisms in section \ref{reconstruction}. Lastly, we discuss limitations and errors in section \ref{limitations} and draw concluding remarks in section \ref{conclusions}.

%\cite{marotzke} present the first implementation of the adjoint model for compute sensitivities of Atlantic heat transport in a 2$^{\circ}$x2$^{\circ}$ resolution model of a truncated Atlantic. \cite{heimbach_timescales} use a larger model and provide physical interpretations for the dynamics in the adjoint model.  

	Our goal is to: show the physical processes and geographical regions which play a key role in governing variability of SAMOC; quantitatively show the contribution of external forcing variability on SAMOC including the time scales over which these processes are effective at governing this variation; discuss the similarities and differences between AMOC at 34S and in the North Atlantic, motivating efforts in setting up reliable observation systems; remark on the errors present in this modeling process; discuss future efforts for improving oceanographic inverse modeling.

\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{theModel}
  \subsection{Model Configuration}

	In this study we use the MITgcm to study the sensitivity of the AMOC at 34$^{\circ}$S to wind, thermal, and fresh water forcing from 1992-2011. The model is configured based on the optimization framework developed by ECCO (version 4, release 2) and is described in greater detail in \cite{forgetECCOv4}. Here we discuss some of the relevant details for completeness. The model grid resolution is roughly $1^{\circ} x 1^{\circ}$ in the horizontal and has 50 vertical depth layers. The model is forced with a realistic atmospheric state based on data from \red{Era Interim} for air temperature and humidity two meters above sea level, long and short wave radiation, precipitation, and wind speed. River runoff is provided \cite{by I don't know}. Wind stress, evaporation, and \red{the resulting heat and salt fluxes from these quantities} are computed with the bulk formula \cite{large2004}. Each of these atmospheric state variables can be downloaded from ecco-group.org/, where the original raw data have been filtered and smoothed as described by the control problem in \cite{forgetECCOv4}. Vertical mixing is parameterized based on \red{TKE?} given by \cite{ggl90}, unresolved eddies are parameterized with a bolus velocity as described in \cite{GM}, and isopycnal diffusivity is discretized as in \cite{redi1982}. The parameter values for each of these schemes is given from the 12th optimization cycle in the ECCO inverse modeling framework \cite{forgetECCOv4} \cite{forgetTurbulent}. No Newtonian relaxation terms are used except in the parameterization of sea ice as described in \red{Duffy 1999} \cite{nguyenSubgrid}. 

	\red{In the same way that a model-data misfit function is computed as an objective function and derivatives with respect to control variables are computed in a data assimilation procedure, we define a physically meaningful objective function and compute the gradient to external forcing.  }
	We take advantage of the ECCOv4r2 inverse modeling procedure to \red{compute sensitivities} to a physically meaningful objective function, rather than a model-data misfit function for data assimilation (see \cite{forgetECCOv4} for a discussion on the development of the adjoint method in the context of ocean inverse modeling). We compute the adjoint of the forward model with respect to external forcing with Transformations of Algorithms in Fortran \cite{giering2005}. Computational details of this procedure in relation to the MITgcm is described in \red{Heimbach, P., Hill, C., and Giering, R.: An efficient exact adjoint of the parallel}. Here we define the objective function as AMOC at 34$^{\circ}$S as in Eqn. \ref{amoc}. This is the closest latitude band resolved in the model configuration to 34.5$^{\circ}$S: the most Southern latitude band in the Atlantic that touches both African and South American continents. This procedure has proven successful for the AMOC at Northern latitudes (see e.g. \cite{pillarAttribution} \cite{heimbachTimescales} \cite{czeschelOscillatory}) and here we explore a similar procedure at the Southern mouth of the Atlantic. 

  \subsection{AMOC definition}
  
    The domain of interest is the zonal cross section of the Atlantic ocean at 34$^{\circ}$S, from the Western coast in the Aghulas Basin to the Cape of Good Hope Basin in the East. In cartesian coordinates, we denote this as: $x \in [x_W,x_E], y = y(\phi=34^{\circ}S), z \in [-H,\eta(y,t)]$ (spherical coordinates are used in the computation, however).  We define the meridional overturning stream function as follows: 
    
    \begin{equation}
      \pderiv[]{\psi_{MOC}}{y}(y,z,t) = \int_{x_W}^{x_E}w(x,y,z,t)\,dx \qquad\text{;}\qquad \pderiv[]{\psi_{MOC}}{z}(y,z,t) = -\int_{x_W}^{x_E}v(x,y,z,t)\,dx .
     \label{eq:mocStf}
    \end{equation}

   Assuming no normal flow at $z = -H$, the stream function is given by:
   \begin{equation}
    \psi_{MOC}(y,z,t) = -\int_{-H}^{z}\int_{x_W}^{x_E}v(x,y,z,t)\,dx\,dz .
    \label{eq:mocStf2}
   \end{equation}

   Note that with this definition, volume transport moving northward is positive. AMOC is defined as the maximum value of this stream function: 
   
   \begin{equation}
    AMOC(y,z_{max},t) = \max_{-H < z < \eta(y,t)}{\psi_{MOC}(y,z,t)} ,
    \label{eq:amoc}
   \end{equation}

   where it is important to note that this value is a function of time and latitude (here denoted as $y$). Here we use monthly mean values for meridional velocity ($\bar{v}$), so that AMOC as a monthly mean quantity. Using results from ECCOv4r2 \cite{forgetEccov4}, the overturning stream function along with its mean and standard deviation over the period 1992-2011 is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:mocStfStats}. At this location and over this time frame, AMOC has a mean value of 14.25 Sv with a standard deviation of 3.14 Sv, where the maximizing depth has a mean and standard deviation 1422m +/- 56m (median depth 1461.4m). This matches output from the OFES from 1986 within standard deviations \cite{dongOFES} but is lower than XBT observations \cite{dong2009} and daily output values \cite{meinenSamoc}. Make a note of how this is not surprising to have a difference becase \cite{meinenSamoc} produces daily output while we look at monthly means, also XBT and aliasing?. \red{But both of these have a higher mean, not talking about variability ... how would the mean be lower?} Note that the vertical grid spacing at this depth is approximately 100m. \red{Mention that AMOC is normally distributed, cite \cite{wunschAmoc}? give measure of normality?}. These are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:samocStats}. Compared to calculations by Meinen et al \cite{meinenSamoc}, these values are slightly lower in the mean, and show far less variation on monthly time periods: they show, in some months, variation up to 30 Sv. I'll discuss these details in section \ref{obsSAMOC}.

 \section{Sensitivity Maps}
 \label{sensitivityMaps}
  
  Here I want to describe the sensitivity maps of the cost function, $\mathcal{J} = AMOC$, to various forcings $\pderiv{\mathcal{J}}{F}$. 
  Also I want to talk about the differences between what is seen in Pillar 
  Similarities in immediate response between all 4 sensitivities 
	  We don't see similar physical patterns to \ref{pillarAttribution} in FWF
	  We find that the wind stress sensitivity patterns are not seasonally dependent, while the heat flux and fresh water flux sensitivities  reconstruction as in \ref{pillarAttribution}
	  Interestingly we do not see oscillatory behavior in the sensitivity patterns going backward in time as Czeschel does
  

   \subsection{Zonal Wind Stress}
    \begin{enumerate}
	\item In the month prior to evaluating the cost function, there is a positive band around 34$^{\circ}$S, indicating that an increase in zonal winds will increase AMOC strength. This positive sensitivity band indicates that a stronger zonal wind will increase Ekman transport locally, which is ``to the left'' in the Southern hemisphere. 
	\item The sensitivity signals are much stronger across the Pacific and Indian ocean basins when compared to AMOC sensitivities measured around 26$^{\circ}$N, (compare to e.g. \cite{pillarAttribution} \cite{heimbach_timescales}). \red{... how to interpret these regions? unsure of the processes which are responsible for transporting these sensitivities.}
	\item Note that the sensitivities in shallow water regions (e.g. near the Bering Strait, North of Australia) are left over from the initial barotropic response. In reverse, a barotropic wave propagates from the objective function evaluation through the global ocean in roughly a day. However, since the barotropic wave speed is $\sqrt{gH}$, $H$ the water depth, these waves propagate slowly in these regions and linger for roughly a week or two. 
	\item \red{Fast barotropic waves carry signal rapidly Northward up the Western coast of SA (an Eastern boundary for the Pacific). Why does this signal oscillate up the coast?} 
	\item \red{Dipole around mid atlantic ridge showing the steering of pressure perturbations around the mid atlantic ridge. How to know this for sure? Access to Pillar's dissertation?}
	\item From a lead time of 1 to 2 months, the Eastern boundary current carries a negative anomaly to the gulf of Guinea, which then travels rapidly along the equatorial wave guide as a Kelvin dual wave. This signal is exactly as seen in e.g. \cite{pillarAttribution}, highlighting the importance of these linear wave dynamics as a sensitivity pathway throughout the Atlantic basin.
	\item As the reverse Kelvin waves travel poleward along the coast, a positive anomaly forms in its wake, which travels Eastward via (dual) baroclinic Rossby waves. These patterns are easily detected by their tilting from the Southwest to Northeast, due to the wave speed which is proportional to $\beta$. \red{could this be due to Ekman upwelling? why does this turn into an oscillating wave structure traveling Westward across the equator}.
	\item Similarly, these baroclinic Rossby waves can be seen near the equator of the Pacific and Indian ocean basins. The signals in the Pacific die out beyond roughly $\pm10^{\circ}$ beyond the equator, again indicating the importance of the equatorial region as a key pathway for communicating anomalies on monthly timescales. The baroclinic Rossby waves in the Indian ocean are much more apparent with higher frequency output (not shown).
	\item Anomalies which travel Southward dissipate rapidly as they are carried by dual Rossby waves into the ACC and pushed into the rough bathymetry of the Drake Passage. 
	\item \red{Interestingly, the sensitivities in zonal wind stress do not go farther south than $\sim$36$^{\circ}$S, which should be the mechanism for wind driven upwelling. Kuhlbrodt mentions that in the Southern ocean wind driven upwelling is an important mechanism for AMOC circulation, but in terms of measuring this we can't see any contribution from this component. Could be due to the strength of the ACC in this region. Beyond one month don't see any sensitivities in the Southern Ocean. Also could just be that 34S is too far away from this upwelling to be important.}
    \end{enumerate}
   \subsection{Meridional Wind Stress}
    \begin{enumerate}
	\item At a lead time of one month, we can see the Mid Atlantic Ridge in between a positive sensitivity to the East and negative to the West. 
	\item \red{Is the dipole on the Western side, just a bit off the coast due to rough topography there? This is at the North of the Argentine Basin where the Rio Grande Rise is located. This could be similar to the pressure steering mentioned in Pillar, except from all four sides: the rise seems to be around the center of 2 dipoles at one month lead time. }
	\item \red{Could the dipole to the East of the Mid Atlantic ridge be caused by the Walvis ridge? The line seems to follow Northeast just along where the ridge would be. Negative sensitivities are just below the ridge, where an increase in meridional wind stress can cause the waves to reflect off the ridge (depth $<1000m$? source?). The negative sensitivity just to the left gets advected in reverse up the Benguela current, then dissipates as it gets pushed into the African continent.}
	\item \red{What does the positive strip along the African coast represent? Does this increase the strength of the Benguela current, and potentially cause Ekman upwelling which feeds into the South Equatorial Current?}
	\item \red{Why would an increase in wind stress along the Agulhas current increase AMOC?}
	\item Can see residual from barotropic response in shallow waters around the globe. 
	\item After one month, baroclinic Rossby waves can be seen tilting the sensitivity patterns to the Northeast. 
	\item \red{baroclinically unstable flanks along subtropical gyres?}
	\item See damping to viscous dissipation at high latitudes with low rossby wave speeds
    \end{enumerate} 
   \subsection{Heat Flux} 
    \begin{enumerate} 
	\item In the first month, sensitivity patterns cover the entire globe as part of a fast barotropic readjustment period. Note that this is not exhibited by Pillar or Czeschel \cite{pillarAttribution}, \cite{czeschelOscillatory} since the model configuration used does not include volume changes to thermal expansion. 
	\item Note that this does have a seasonal signal 
	\item Note how there is no oscillation and it doesn't matter how far back in time we go after the readjustment period, the signatures look the same with a different magnitude
	\item Important regions ... where is the memory? it's where the water needs to sink ... 
	\item note that Greenland area does not incorporate any ice melt processes 
	\item After the initial readjustment period:
	\item A seasonal cycle develops, going backward in time. 
	\item Main difference here is the connection with the global ocean: the Pacific and Indian oceans remain strongly sensitive regions over decadal timescales because of the connection to the Southern Ocean at 34S. Even though these patterns are not particularly strong, it takes roughly 10 years or more for the basin-wide signals to decay by an order of magnitude. (when considering the spatial RMS of sensitivity as a function of time).  
	\item The strong ACC overpowers the reverse Rossby waves, and sensitivities are carried Westward. The signal dissipates 
    \end{enumerate} 
   \subsection{FWF}
    \begin{enumerate}
	\item Note that there is no seasonal cycle
	\item Note that after a readjustment period there is a ''breathing`` in the important regions but for the most part things stay the same 
	\item again, no oscillation over long time period
    \end{enumerate} 


  \section{Reconstruction and Attribution of Variability}
  \label{reconstruction}
  
  We define an objective function $\mathcal{J}$ as the monthly mean value of AMOC as in Eqn. \ref{eq:amoc}. Using the adjoint mode of the MITgcm, we compute the sensitivity of the objective function to external forcing: $\pderiv{\mathcal{J}}{\mathcal{F}_k}$, where $\mathcal{F}_k$ is the wind stress and net heat and salt fluxes. These fluxes are computed based on the near surface atmospheric state provided by the ERA-Interim re-analysis fields from 1992-2011 \red{Dee et al, from ECCOv4}. 
	
  We take the objective function to be split into its 20 year mean and monthly anomaly components: 

	\begin{equation}
	  \mathcal{J}(t) = \bar{\mathcal{J}} + \delta\mathcal{J}(t) 
	\end{equation}

  The monthly anomaly in AMOC, $\delta\mathcal{J}(t)$, depends on external forcing such that the AMOC anomaly for a given month can be reconstructed offline via the \red{cross-correlation} integral:
 
	\begin{equation}
	  \delta\mathcal{J}(t) = \sum_k\int_{t_0}^{t}\int_x \int_y\pderiv{\mathcal{J}}{\mathcal{F}_k}(x,y,\tau-t)\delta\mathcal{F}_k(x,y,\tau)\, dxdyd\tau  
	  \label{eq:reconstruct}
	\end{equation}

  where the subscript $k$ refers to each of the momentum and buoyancy fluxes. The integral in time is carried out over the interval $[t_0, t]$ so that this range denotes the ``memory'' of the objective function. In reality each of these integrals are a summation over each dimension, where time is discretized into monthly values. The reconstruction for AMOC at 34$^{\circ}$ is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:fullReconstruction}, where the memory time interval is roughly \red{4 years}.
 
  \red{Proof for why this works?}  

   \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{reconstruct.34S/monthly_flux/full_reconstruct}
    \caption{SAMOC reconstructed as in Eqn. \ref{eq:reconstruct} with monthly accumulated sensitivities and atmospheric forcing due to the wind stress and net heat and salt fluxes. ``Memory'' time is \red{4 years}. Monthly values are reconstructed with their associated sensitivities.}
    \label{fig:fullReconstruction}
   \end{figure}

 \section{Limitations}
 \label{limitations}
  \subsection{Exploring reconstruction memory \& buoyancy contributions}

  When reconstructing AMOC as in Eqn. \ref{eq:reconstruct} with only December sensitivities ($\pderiv{\mathcal{J}}{\mathcal{F}_k}$), increasing the memory time significantly changes the quality and phase of the reconstruction (see Fig. \ref{fig:phaseChangeAqh}). This phase change arises because the ocean responds to changes in buoyancy flux related variables differently during different months of the year, so the sensitivity profiles are different depending on the month when AMOC is evaluated. See Fig. \ref{fig:bigPlotHflux} for how June and December sensitivities look in different regions of the world. Notably in the ACC, Atlantic, Arctic, and the area around Greenland. See Fig. \ref{fig:bigPlotTauu} for how these sensitivities are almost identical for wind stress. Thus, when performing the heat flux reconstruction with monthly sensitivities (but removing the zeros this time ...), the phase change goes away, only amplitude increases with memory time (see Fig. \ref{fig:hflux}). It makes sense that using December only would cause a phase change in the reconstructed signal, because the $\delta\mathcal{F}_k(x,y,t)$ \& $\pderiv{\mathcal{J}}{\mathcal{F}_k}$ fields may introduce interference for summer vs winter months (for example).

  So this seems to imply that it is actually important to compute monthly sensitivities for an accurate reconstruction. However, the reconstruction from wind stress essentially ``nails it''. See Fig. \ref{fig:windReconstruct}. The error $\delta\mathcal{J}(t)_{full} - \delta\mathcal{J}(t)_{wind}$ is quite noisy and has no notable peaks in its frequency spectrum other than at $1 \& 2 yr^{-1}$, see Figs. \ref{fig:windRecError} \& \ref{fig:freqWindRecError}. Additionally, when considering the two norm of the reconstruction error from the forward model, the quality only gets worse when buoyancy fluxes are added (Fig. \ref{fig:reconstructError}). This makes me curious 'what is missing' from the wind only reconstruction. Is this the only important mechanism that we can detect at 34S? Is this the only latitude where this is true or is this the same for all southern latitudes?  

  Compare the reconstruction at 34S to that at 26N. There we can see a notable pattern in the error $\delta\mathcal{J}(t)_{full} - \delta\mathcal{J}(t)_{wind}$, Fig \ref{fig:windRecError26N}, and there is a strong peak at 1/10 $yr^{-1}$ in the frequency spectrum (Fig. \ref{fig:freqWindRecError26N}). I can't say anything about adding heat/salt flux here to make up for this component though because I only have December evaluated objective functions completed. However, the shape looks similar to that in Pillar \cite{pillarAttribution}, although the amplitude is smaller.

  This leaves a lot of questions: 
  \begin{enumerate}
	\item Is wind stress the only important component in AMOC variability that is detectable over a 20 yr time frame? and with ECCO
	\item Is this true for the Southern hemisphere or only at 34S? 
	\item why does the reconstruction get worse with buoyancy fluxes, and why does divergence happen after only 4-5 years? (as opposed to Pillar, 15 yrs)?
	\item Why is there a decadal mode in the north? is this recirculation in the sub tropical gyre? equatorial buffer? 
	\item Why does the hflux contribution only look like a seasonally oscillating cycle while in Pillar they didn't see this andor saw decadal mode? Does this just dominate, and are my plotting scales making this seem like it is the case? 
 \end{enumerate}

  Considering signs: I am using the following variables for reconstruction with fluxes. 
  \begin{enumerate}
	\item Wind stress: dJdF corresponds to tauutauv, dF corresponds to the diagnostics oceTAUXY or ExfTauxy. Either seems to produce the same result. 
	\item Heat flux: dJ/dF corresponds to exf variable hflux ($>0 => $decrease in Temp.). dF corresponding to oceQnet ($>0 => $ocean heating, increase in Temp), exfQnet ($>0 =>$ ocean cooling, decrease in Temp). The profiles of these look very different in the Arctic... what is the difference? 
	\item Salt flux: dJ/dF corresponds to exf variable sflux ($>0 =>$ increase in salt). dF corresponds to exfEmpmr ($>0 => $increase in salinity). 
  \end{enumerate}

  \subsection{Monthly variability propagation}

  My goal here is to get a measure of the variability in momentum and buoyancy fluxes and determine how this variation effects the AMOC at 34S. Which component sees the most variation? Is the variation in AMOC explained by deviations from climatological mean values for e.g. wind stress? For each flux denoted by subscript $k$:

  \begin{equation}
	\mathcal{F}_k(x,y,t) = \bar{\mathcal{F}_k}(x,y)_{20yr} + \delta\mathcal{F}_k(x,y,t)
  \end{equation}

  \begin{equation}
	\delta\mathcal{F}_k(x,y,t) = \delta\mathcal{F}_{km}^{clim}(x,y) + \delta\mathcal{F}_{k}^{anom}(x,y,t)
  \end{equation}

  \begin{equation}
	\delta\mathcal{F}_{km}^{clim}(x,y) = \dfrac{1}{20}\sum_n\delta\mathcal{F}_k(x,y,t=m+n) \qquad n \in [0,12,24,...,240]
  \end{equation}

  So what I tried is to reconstruct $\mathcal{J}(t)'$ with:

  \begin{equation}
	\delta\mathcal{F}_k(x,y,t) = \delta\mathcal{F}_{km}^{clim}(x,y) \pm \sigma_{km}(x,y)	
  \end{equation}

  where $\sigma_{km}(x,y)$ is the standard deviation of $\delta\mathcal{F}_k(x,y,t)$, my measure of deviation from climatological mean. 

  \red{Need to try this again when taking std of F\_k not the anomaly from F\_clim}

  \subsection{Forward Perturbation Experiments} 

  In order to test the linearity assumption in the reconstruction I perturbed the heat flux in a forward model similarly to \cite{czeschelOscillatory}. Here I added a perturbation of $10 W/m^2$ to the region around Greenland (the area with the longest lasting sensitivities). 
  \begin{figure}

	\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{hf-perturb/hflux__m10}
	\caption{Perturbation in the variable oceQnet is $10 W/m^2$ over the box $45-80^{\circ}N$, inside the Atlantic. Note that since this is just oceQnet the perturbation doesn't show up where there is ice.}
