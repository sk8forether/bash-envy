\begin{abstract}
  We are interested in the variability of AMOC at 34$^{\circ}$S over time scales ranging from a few months to ~10-20 years. This location is of particular interest because there are two pilot boundary arrays located here (at 34.5$^{\circ}$): on the Eastern boundary two sensors as part of the GoodHope program (Feb2008-Dec2010) and the Southwest Atlantic MOC array (deployed March 2009) on the Western boundary \cite{meinenSamoc}. These systems are made up of Inverted Echo Sounders (IES), with a pressure sensor (PIES), and in some places a current meter (CPIES). While these arrays were not put in place to monitor AMOC, we use the data provided to compare computer model calculations of the AMOC. Here we use the MITgcm parameters fit to observations as in ECCO v4 r2 (much more here) \cite{forgetEccov4}. Defining the AMOC as an objective function and using the adjoint mode of this code allows us to compute sensitivities of AMOC to various external forcings (wind stress, buoyancy fluxes, ...). The purpose here is to find the causal mechanisms of variability and the timescales on which they act. While a 20 year time frame is not nearly enough to establish statistically meaningful trends in AMOC's behavior, it is certainly true that continuing or reestablishing observation systems will give a clearer picture of AMOC's low frequency variability and trends.

\section{Methods}
\label{methods}
  
  \subsection{AMOC definition}
  
    The domain of interest is the zonal cross section of the Atlantic ocean at 34$^{\circ}$S, from the Western coast in the Aghulas Basin to the Cape of Good Hope Basin in the East. In cartesian coordinates, we denote this as: $x \in [x_W,x_E], y = y(\phi=34^{\circ}S), z \in [-H,\eta(y,t)]$ (spherical coordinates are used in the computation, however).  We define the meridional overturning stream function as follows: 
    
    \begin{equation}
      \pderiv[]{\psi_{MOC}}{y}(y,z,t) = \int_{x_W}^{x_E}w(x,y,z,t)\,dx \qquad\text{;}\qquad \pderiv[]{\psi_{MOC}}{z}(y,z,t) = -\int_{x_W}^{x_E}v(x,y,z,t)\,dx .
     \label{eq:mocStf}
    \end{equation}

   Assuming no normal flow at $z = -H$, the stream function is given by:
   \begin{equation}
    \psi_{MOC}(y,z,t) = -\int_{-H}^{z}\int_{x_W}^{x_E}v(x,y,z,t)\,dx\,dz .
    \label{eq:mocStf2}
   \end{equation}

   Note that with this definition, volume transport moving northward is positive. AMOC is defined as the maximum value of this stream function: 
   
   \begin{equation}
    AMOC(y,z_{max},t) = \max_{-H < z < \eta(y,t)}{\psi_{MOC}(y,z,t)} ,
    \label{eq:amoc}
   \end{equation}

   where it is important to note that this value is a function of time and latitude (here denoted as $y$). Here we use monthly mean values for meridional velocity ($\bar{v}$), so that AMOC as a monthly mean quantity. Using results from ECCOv4r2 \cite{forgetEccov4}, the overturning stream function along with its mean and standard deviation over the period 1992-2011 is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:mocStfStats}. At this location and over this time frame, AMOC has a mean value of 10.85 Sv with a standard deviation of 3.13 Sv, where the maximizing depth has a mean and standard deviation 1106m +/- 83m. Note that the vertical grid spacing at this depth is approximately 100m. \red{Mention that AMOC is normally distributed, cite \cite{wunschAndHeimbach_AMOC}? give measure of normality?}. These are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:samocStats}. These values are quite different from what is computed by Meinen  \cite{meinenSamoc},

  \subsection{Linear Sensitivity}
  \label{linearSensitivity}
  
  We define an objective function $\mathcal{J}$ as the monthly mean value of AMOC as in Eqn. \ref{eq:amoc}. Using the adjoint mode of the MITgcm, we then compute the sensitivity of the objective function to model inputs. In this case, the inputs consist of external forces: wind stress, heat, and freshwater fluxes.
