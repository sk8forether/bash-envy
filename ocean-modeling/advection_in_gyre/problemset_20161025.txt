This experiment serves a number of purposes for this class:
* it uses the versatile "diagnostics" package
  (but only in a limited way, as configured here);
* it uses the passive tracers ("ptracers") package;
* it demonstrates the impact of various advection schemes;

Based on the default setup, I suggest simulations to be run with following changes:

1. modify ptracers such as to use 2 passive tracers 
   (currently uses 1, based on initial concentration prescribd in file "dye.bin")
   place initial concentration of second tracer in the middle of the lower gyre,
   i.e. position i=30, j=15, k=1
   Hints:
   o file PTRACERS_SIZE.h needs to be adjusted for compile-time
   o adapt runtime parameter file data.ptracers accordingly

2. Change runtime parameter file "data" such as to 
   * run for 10 years (starting from a 10-yr pickup file that is provided)
   * change dumpFreq and monitorFreq to monthly (in seconds)

3. With these changes perform several simulations using different advection schemes.
   I suggest the following (prescribed via PTRACERS_advScheme number):
   * 80 (2nd Order-Moment Advection Scheme, Prather, 1986) -- default in this setup
   * 33 (3rd order Direct-Space-Time, with flux limiter)
   * 30 (3rd order Direct-Space-Time, without flux limiter)
   * 3 (3rd order upwind)

The diagnostics package will produce monthly tracer fields (PTRAC1, PTRAC2)
that are worth looking at.
